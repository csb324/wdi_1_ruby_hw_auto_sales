TO DO LIST

make a car
  a car has a make, model, year, MSRP, and markup
  from that stuff, we can figure out its value
  from THAT we can figure out the price

make a used car
  it's like a car
  it has a mileage
  it might/might not have damage -- damage causes more depreciation
  value and price are different because of mileage and damage

make damage
  damage has a description and a cost

make car lot
  has a name
  has a bunch of cars
  can retrieve total price of all cars on lot
  can retrieve list of cars with year == 2008, make == Ford, etc
